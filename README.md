## NutriHelp - Aiming to promote healthy eating habits for Australia's senior population

---

NutriHelp is an Android and Web application that aims to promote healthy eating habits for Australia's senior population,
by providing personalised recipes based on the user's specified health conditions and nutritional preferences.
Our goal is to decrease the number of elderly people that are either malnourished or at risk of malnutrition,
promote nutritional health through food intake and increase transparency and awareness of our userâ€™s current nutritional health.
