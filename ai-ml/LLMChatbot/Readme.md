# NutriHelp Chatbot

NutriHelp Chatbot is an AI-powered application developed as part of the NutriHelp project at Deakin University, spearheaded by Gopher Industries. It serves as a tool to address inquiries related to nutrition and health. The chatbot leverages the cutting-edge GPT-3.5 Model from OpenAI to provide intelligent responses to user queries.

## Implementations

### Flask Implementation

The Flask implementation of NutriHelp Chatbot is contained within the file `flask_chatbot_implementation.py`. To run this implementation, you will need the `flask` library installed in your Python environment. The `templates` folder holds HTML scripts necessary for Flask to render the user interface. This implementation is ideal for developers who wish to work directly on the Python script, customize the chatbot, and conduct further prompt engineering.

### Node.js Implementation

The `nodejs-chatbot-implementation` directory contains a demonstration of integrating the Python script with a Node.js server. This implementation showcases how the chatbot can be seamlessly integrated into the NutriHelp website using a Node.js server with the `child-process` module. Developers can follow a similar procedure to incorporate the chatbot functionality into their web applications.
