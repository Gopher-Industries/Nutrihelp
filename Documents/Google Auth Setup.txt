expo prebuild - this builds the app.json file and android development 
Did this to get user details after google auth

Build name: com.gopher.nutrihelp

---------------------------------------------------------------------


Build commands for login authentication:
npx expo install expo-auth-session expo-crypto expo-web-browser expo-random

npx expo install expo-updates

npx expo install expo-application



Current Issue: Expo setup with android google login doesn't seem to work 
will need to research this first to get user details from google login.

eas build:configure

this will configure build profile 
makes the eas.json file 
has the build profile for dev and


eas credentials 

this will give sha1 fingerprint for android client ID 

basic setups for all of them 


Current issue: cannot setup logout on the right page
it logs out the same place it logs in from 
need to setup logout in nutrition page, 
Tried method is calling the logout function inside google auth 
doesn't work

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


With google OAuth IDs 
sometimes it will say error while loggin in "Error: deleted_client",
this means that the Oauth tokens have exipred, Need to go to google
developer cloud and create new tokens using steps above. 


Logout Screen is setup, it will remove persistence on Emulator 
and it will logout completely on standalone.
