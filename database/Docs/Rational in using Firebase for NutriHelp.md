## **Types of databases considered:**  

Relational database 
- Stores information in tables where relationships can be established to link multiple tables together.
- Uses columns to define the information being stored and rows for actual record keeping.
- The commonest way to interact with a relational database is with Structured Query Language (SQL).

Non-Relational database
- Is a database that is the opposite of a relational database such that it does not use tables, fields, and columns to store data. It stores data by document format commonly JSON-like, by key and value, by nodes in graph databases or by wide columns like relational databases.
- This type of database is designed with cloud networking in mind.

## **Advantages and Disadvantages**

As NutriHelp is designed as a 2-component product (android app and web app) requiring high flexibility and performance, the best database type to use is non-relational databases.

## **What non-relational databases are available on the market:**
